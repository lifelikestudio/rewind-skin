      Additional Disclosures for Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) Compliance
      (Canada)
    </h3>
    <h4 class="all-caps legal-main__sub-heading">Additional scope of personal information</h4>
    <p class="main-body">
      In accordance with PIPEDA, we broaden our definition of personal information to include any information about an
      individual, such as financial information, information about your appearance, your views and opinion (such as
      those expressed online or through a survey), opinions held about you by others, and any personal correspondences
      you may have with us. While this information may not directly identify you, be aware that it may be combined with
      other information to do so.
    </p>
    <p class="main-body">
      As PIPEDA refers to personal information using the term Personally Identifying Information (PII), any references
      to personal information and PII in this privacy policy, and in official communications from Rewind Skin, are
      intended as equivalent to one another in every way, shape and form.
    </p>

    <h4 class="all-caps legal-main__sub-heading">Valid Consent</h4>
    <p class="main-body">
      Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for a specific purpose. You may withdraw
      your consent at any time using the facilities we provide; however this will not affect any use of your information
      that has already taken place. When you contact us, we assume your consent based on your positive action of
      contact, therefore you consent to your name and email address being used so we can respond to your enquiry. Under
      PIPEDA, consent is only valid if it is reasonable to expect that an individual to whom the organization's
      activities are directed would understand the nature, purpose, and consequences of the collection, use, or
      disclosure of the personal information to which they are consenting.
    </p>
    <p class="main-body">
      Where you agree to receive marketing communications from us, we will do so based solely on your indication of
      consent or until you instruct us not to, which you can do at any time.
    </p>
    <p class="main-body">
      While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time, we cannot recall any email we have already
      sent. If you have any further enquiries about how to withdraw your consent, please feel free to enquire using the
      details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h4 class="all-caps legal-main__sub-heading">International Transfers of Information</h4>
    <p class="main-body">
      While Rewind Skin endeavors to keep, store and handle customer data within locations in Canada, it may use agents
      or service providers located in the United States (U.S.), European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK) to
      collect, use, retain and process personal information as part of providing services to you. While we use all
      reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information receives the same level of security in any other
      jurisdiction as it would in Canada, please be aware that privacy protections under U.S. laws may not be the same
      adequacy.
    </p>

    <h4 class="all-caps legal-main__sub-heading">Customer Data Rights</h4>
    <p class="main-body">
      Although PIPEDA does not contain an extensive set of consumer rights, it does grant consumers the right to:
    </p>
    <ul class="main-body">
      <li>Access the personal information organizations hold about them;</li>
      <li>
        Correct any inaccurate or outdated personal information the organization hold about them (or, if this is not
        possible, delete the inaccurate personal information)
      </li>
      <li>Withdraw consent for any activities for which they have consented (e.g. direct marketing or cookies)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="all-caps legal-main__sub-heading">Right to Withdraw Consent</h4>
    <p class="main-body">
      Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for a specific purpose. Subject to some
      restrictions, you can, at any time, refuse to consent, or continue to consent to the collection, use or disclosure
      of their personal information by notifying us using the email address below in the 'Contact Us' section.
      Withdrawal of consent may impact our ability to provide or continue to provide services.
    </p>
    <p class="main-body">
      Customers cannot refuse collection, use and disclosure of their personal information if such information is
      required to:
    </p>
    <ul class="main-body">
      <li>be collected, used or disclosed as required by any law;</li>
      <li>fulfill the terms of any contractual agreement; and</li>
      <li>be collected, used or disclosed as required by any regulators including self regulatory organizations</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h4 class="all-caps legal-main__sub-heading">Right of Access under PIPEDA</h4>
    <p class="main-body">
      PIPEDA gives you a general right to access the PII held by businesses subject to this law. Under PIPEDA, you need
      to make your access request in writing and pay a minimal fee of $30.00.
    </p>
    <p class="main-body">
      If any organizational fees seem unjust, you have the right to complain about this. We retain the right to decide
      how we disclose the copies of your PII to you. We will take all necessary measures to fulfill your request in 30
      days from receipt, otherwise we must inform you of our inability to do so before the 30-day timeframe if:
    </p>
    <ul class="main-body">
      <li>meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with our business activities; or</li>
      <li>
        the time required to undertake consultations necessary to respond to the request would make it impractical to
        meet the time limit.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="main-body">
      We can also extend the time limit for the length of time required to convert the personal information into an
      alternative format. In these circumstances, we will advise you of the delay within the first 30 days and explain
      the reason for it.
    </p>

    <h4 class="all-caps legal-main__sub-heading">Right of rectification under PIPEDA</h4>
    <p class="main-body">
      You may request a correction to any factual errors or omissions within your PII. We would ask you to provide some
      evidence to back up your claim. Under PIPEDA, an organization must amend the information, as required, if you
      successfully demonstrate that it's incomplete or inaccurate.
    </p>
    <p class="main-body">
      You may contact us at any time, using the information provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy if
      you believe your PII on our systems is incorrect or incomplete.
    </p>
    <p class="main-body">
      If we cannot agree on changing the information, you have the right to have your concerns recorded with the Office
      of the Privacy Commission of Canada.
    </p>

    <h4 class="all-caps legal-main__sub-heading">Compliance with PIPEDA's Ten Principles of Privacy</h4>
